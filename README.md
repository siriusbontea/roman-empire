## Mapping the Infrastructure of the Roman Empire

##### Webpage:
[https://siriusbontea.github.io/roman-empire/](https://siriusbontea.github.io/roman-empire/)

##### Overview:
- This project will attempt to provide an interactive mapping visualisation of Roman territorial expansion from 500 B.C. to A.D. 200. The primary focus is on Roman roads as it correlates to the growth of the empire. The Roman road network directly contributed to commerce, ease of travel, and enabled rapid movement of Roman armies and logistical resupply.

- Why Roman roads anyway? They're longer lasting than modern roads! Some of these ancient roads didn't see much degradation until tanks rolled over them during World War 2, but even so, the roads were still in decent shape after the fact. Furthermore, Roman roads were marvels in engineering in terms of placement and would give the modern surveyor the run for their money if there was a contest of who could make a straighter road far over the horizon.

- This project was built to meet requirements for Modules 8-10 of the [MAP 673: Design For Interactive Web Mapping](https://newmapsplus.github.io/map673/syllabus/) course at the [University of Kentucky](https://newmapsplus.as.uky.edu/).

##### Anticipated Technology Requirements:
- QGIS - Most of the heavy lifting behind the scenes is with QGIS for vector layer creation, editing, analysis, and processing of data prior to use for web mapping. Georeferencing of raster data, such as scans of hand drawn maps, will be done with QGIS.
- VS Code - code editing and interaction with GitHub
- GIMP - General editing and processing of raster images 
- Inkscape - General editing of SVGs data
- GeoJSON - file format for most map data
- CSV - file format for some of the map data (to save on file size if necessary)
- HTML, CSS, JS
     - Leaflet - Primary JS library for mapping requirements, user-interface, etc.
     - PapaParse and omnivore - JS libraries for processing CSV data for use with Leaflet
     - Bootstrap - JS/CSS library for general layout, theme, and styles
- Github Pages (maybe Mapbox?)
- Adobe Stock Photos (SVGs for map icons, etc.)
- [Convertio](https://convertio.co/) used to convert Adobe Illustrator (.ai) files to SVG.
- possibly other hosting service for larger data (i.e., map tiles). 

##### Data files:
- Roman roads, aqueducts, bridges (ShapeFiles) from the [Ancient World Mapping Center](https://awmc.unc.edu/wordpress/map-files/).

- Ultimately, AWMC's [shapefile directory](https://awmc.unc.edu/awmc/map_data/shapefiles/political_shading/) has a decent collection of politcal maps showing the Roman Empire at various extents (from 60 B.C. to A.D. 200). However, the shapefiles were crude and did not align with shapefiles from Natural Earth's [10m Physical Vectors](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/), nor did they align to major natural physical barriers such as large rivers. Furthermore, I was unable to locate and vector files for the Early Roman Republic.

- Due to these shortfalls, I used QGIS to create the vector files I needed and align them with the Natural Earth vector files.<sup>1</sup> I referred to the various reference maps (see list below) to create additional vector files for the following time periods:

     - [500 B.C. extent](data/500BC_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON
     - [338 B.C. extent](data/338BC_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON
     - [298 B.C. extent](data/298BC_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON
     - [290 B.C. extent](data/290BC_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON
     - [272 B.C. extent](data/272BC_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON
     - [264 B.C. extent](data/264BC_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON
     - [218 B.C. extent](data/218BC_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON
     - [133 B.C. extemt](data/133BC_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON<sup>2</sup>
     - [60 B.C. extent](data/60BC_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON
     - [A.D. 14 extent](data/AD14_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON
     - [A.D. 69 extent](data/AD69_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON
     - [A.D. 117 extent](data/AD117_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON
     - [A.D. 200 extent](data/AD200_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON
     - [Max extent](data/max_extent_intersection.geojson) GeoJSON<sup>3</sup>

*Notes:* 
<br/> <sup>1</sup> Some of these vector files, are still a bit rough (in my opinion), and will be further refined.
<br/> <sup>2</sup> There are inconsistencies for the 133 B.C. maps depending on the source material and will be the highest priority for revision.
<br/> <sup>3</sup> The "Max extent" vector file is *not* to be used denote a particular time period, but rather to be used for clipping/intersection work within QGIS.  For example, regions in Mesopotamia and Germania Magna were temporary holdings at best or areas of Roman influence due to road/trade networks (and not necessarily Roman conquered territories).

##### Other Resources:
- Font selection for this project attepts to be as close to authentic Roman inscriptions as possible. The [Trajan font](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/trajan#fonts-section) from the [Adobe Font Collection](https://fonts.adobe.com/) is based upon the [carved inscription on the Trajan column](http://codex99.com/typography/21.html) at the Basilica Ulpia in the Forum of Trajan and depicts the Emperor Trajan's own account of his conquest of Emperor Trajanâ€™s own account of his compaigns leading to the conquest of Decebalus (A.D. 101 - 102) and the annexation of Dacia (A.D. 105 - 106).

- Colours are based on the [dyes used by the Romans](https://www.jennydean.co.uk/colours-of-the-romans/) which often had [symobolism](https://ancient-rome.info/ancient-roman-colors-symbolism/) in mind. Additionally, materials such as parchment are normally much brighter when newly made compared to the darker hues we see in museums due to aging. Due to variability in the dyes, pigments, and materials used, its nearly impossible to create a perfect match on a webpage. However, I'll do the best I can to provide a close approximation.

##### User-Interface:
- A mobile-friendly responsive Leaflet map will be means to deliver content.

- The map will use a "time slider" and infrastructure "layers" that can be toggled. This interactivity afforded to the user is to assist in visualisation of these changes (i.e., expansion of Roman infrastructure) and hopefully show the importance of the role of lines of communication and how it correlates with the increase in trade and expansion of the empire.

- Popups over key locations will provide the user with additional information, links, and graphics.

- custom icons will be used to represent key locations (major cities, key terrain), location types (forts, towns), cultural areas (tribal locations), politcal boundaries (provicial areas).
