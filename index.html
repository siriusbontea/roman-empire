                    <p>There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. We don't
                        really know where this
                        goes - and I'm not sure we really care. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.
                        Think about a cloud.
                        Just float around and be there. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. We don't
                        want to set these
                        clouds on fire.</p>

                    <p>That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as
                        happy as I want it.
                        Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. The very fact that you're
                        aware of suffering is
                        enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. In painting, you have
                        unlimited power. You
                        have the ability to move mountains. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. There's
                        not a thing in the
                        world wrong with washing your brush. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an
                        artist license. Only
                        eight colors that you need. This is the way you take out your flustrations.</p>

                    <p>Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Now we don't want him to get
                        lonely, so we'll give
                        him a little friend. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This
                        is your creation -
                        and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting
                        colder. It's cold, but
                        it's beautiful. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Mountains are so
                        simple, they're hard.
                        We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. In life you need colors.
                    </p>

                    <p>In this world, everything can be happy. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. It's a good way of
                        getting rid of all your
                        anxieties and hostilities. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Let's have
                        a happy little tree
                        in here.</p>

                    <p>You can do anything your heart can imagine. Every single thing in the world has its own
                        personality - and it is up to
                        you to make friends with the little rascals. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little
                        tree here. Now it's
                        beginning to make a little sense. All kinds of happy little splashes. Work that paint. Water's
                        like me. It's laaazy
                        ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things We'll make some happy little bushes
                        here. Let's do it
                        again then, what the heck. Happy painting, God bless.</p>

                    <p>Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We spend so much of our life looking -
                        but never seeing.
                        Trees grow however makes them happy. This is an example of what you can do with just a few
                        things, a little
                        imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Mix
                        your color marbly
                        don't mix it dead. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Just relax and let it flow. That
                        easy.</p>

                    <p>In your world you can create anything you desire. These trees are so much fun. I get started on
                        them and I have a
                        hard time stopping. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. I really recommend
                        you use odorless
                        thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by
                        yourself. Let your
                        imagination be your guide. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy
                        when you're doing these
                        little delicate things.</p>

                    <p>If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your
                        floor wet. Let's
                        have a nice tree right here. You need the dark in order to show the light. You better get your
                        coat out, this is
                        going to be a cold painting. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.</p>

                    <p>A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Volunteering your time; it pays you
                        and your whole
                        community fantastic dividends. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.
                        I guess that would
                        be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.
                        Nature is so
                        fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy.</p>

                    <p>You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.
                        Let's just drop a
                        little Evergreen right here. And maybe, maybe, maybe... This is a fantastic little painting.
                        Little short strokes.
                        Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a
                        little bit of Sap
                        Green. You can get away with a lot. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend
                        your time thinking
                        about what's happening - you just let it happen. Let's make some happy little clouds in our
                        world.</p>

                    <p>We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. We don't have anything but happy trees
                        here. Isn't it great
                        to do something you can't fail at? Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to
                        build the framework
                        first. Don't fiddle with it all day. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a
                        camera. I guess I'm a
                        little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most
                        people.</p>

                    <p>This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the
                        house or taking it out
                        on your spouse. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you
                        believe you can do
                        strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. It's so important to do something
                        every day that will
                        make you happy. There it is. Learn when to stop. Making all those little fluffies that live in
                        the clouds. You can
                        do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. But we're not there yet,
                        so we don't need to
                        worry about it. This is gonna be a happy little seascape.</p>

                    <p>If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get
                        better. See how easy it
                        is to create a little tree right in your world. Fluff that up. When you do it your way you can
                        go anywhere you
                        choose. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Maybe there's a happy
                        little Evergreen that
                        lives here. Let's do that again. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.</p>

                    <p>I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little
                        rabbits and stuff.
                        You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. If you do too much it's going to lose its
                        effectiveness. Maybe
                        there's a happy little bush that lives right there. We don't make mistakes we just have happy
                        little accidents. We
                        tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely
                        addicted to painting. It
                        doesn't take much to get you addicted. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort.
                        Having a good day.
                        Have fun with it.</p>

                    <p>Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Anything you want to do you can do here.
                        If we're gonna walk
                        though the woods, we need a little path. All those little son of a guns. The first step to doing
                        anything is to
                        believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. It takes dark in
                        order to show light.
                        Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.</p>
